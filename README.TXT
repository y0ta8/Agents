# Defense Agents & Central Orchestrator System  
A Lightweight Cyber Defense Experimentation Framework

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a simplified cyber-defense framework consisting of:

- **Windows Defense Agent (PowerShell-based)**
- **Linux Defense Agent (Bash/Python-based)**
- **Central Orchestrator (Python)**
- **Knowledge Base (KB.csv)**
- **Event Processing Rules (EP.json)**
- **Correlation Engine (matcher.py)**

The goal is to simulate a realistic cyber-defense environment where multiple endpoints send events to a central server (the Orchestrator), which performs detection and correlation of suspicious behavior.

This framework is designed as part of a graduation project (Agents Project) and provides a modular environment for analyzing multi-stage attacks, running detection rules, and improving response logic.
